## Installation

Fork this [Github repository](https://github.com/kylehackett99/HourWork) to install a local version of the HourWork Study Assistant.

## Usage
On the home page, click on upload file and upload the sample file or a file of your own.

The flashcard will be on the left side with a previous(left) and next(right) button.

There will also be three buttons to be selected based off your understanding: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

The Mind Map will be on the right side. Each node will be connected to a flashcard. Users are able to click on each node which would prompt the flashcard
to the left.

Users should work their way through their deck of flash cards using the next and previous buttons, and self report the difficulty they experienced in recalling the information on that card.
